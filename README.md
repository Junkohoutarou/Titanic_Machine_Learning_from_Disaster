# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project involves exploring and analyzing the provided dataset, preparing the data for machine learning models, and implementing various classification algorithms to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## Dataset:
The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including features such as age, gender, class, and fare. The target variable is binary, indicating whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0).

## Tasks:
1. **Data Exploration:** Analyze the dataset, check for missing values, and gain insights into the distribution of features.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection:** Experiment with various classification algorithms such as [Gradient Boosting](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#gradient-boosting), [Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#random-forests), [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [Decision Trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html).
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize the selected model's hyperparameters to improve its predictive performance.
7. **Model Deployment:** Deploy the chosen model for predicting survival outcomes on new data.

## Tools and Technologies:

- **Data Visualization:** [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- **Version Control:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/)

## Deliverables:
1. **Jupyter Notebooks:** Clearly documented notebooks containing the entire data analysis and modeling process.
2. **Model Evaluation Report:** A report summarizing the performance of each machine learning model.
3. **Code Repository:** [GitHub repository](https://github.com/) with well-organized and version-controlled code.

## Conclusion:
This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world dataset, making predictions about the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The outcome will serve as a demonstration of data exploration, preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation processes in a typical machine learning project.
