# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project involves exploring and analyzing the provided dataset, preparing the data for machine learning models, and implementing various classification algorithms to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## Dataset:
The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including features such as age, gender, class, and fare. The target variable is binary, indicating whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0).

## Tasks:
1. **Data Exploration:** Analyze the dataset, check for missing values, and gain insights into the distribution of features.
2. **Data Wrangling:**
    - **Handling Missing Values:**
        - **Simple Imputer:** Impute missing values using methods such as mean or median.
        - **MissingPy Imputer:** Utilize advanced imputation techniques from the [MissingPy](https://pypi.org/project/missingpy/) library.
    - **Feature Engineering:**
        - Create new features or modify existing ones to capture valuable information.
        - Explore techniques like binning, one-hot encoding, and creating interaction terms.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, and handle any remaining missing values.
4. **Feature Selection:** Use feature importance techniques or dimensionality reduction methods to select relevant features.
5. **Model Selection:** Experiment with a variety of classification algorithms:
